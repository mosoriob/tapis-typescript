# `tapis-typescript` examples

## Building

The example scripts must first be built with:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuring

You will need to change your local copy of [`example.env`](./example.env) to point to a
TAPIS tenant with a valid username and password.

## Running

Once this project is built, you may run two sample clients:

```
npm run tenants
npm run systems
```
